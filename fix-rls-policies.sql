-- Fix for Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, drop the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view company members" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage company users" ON users;

-- Create corrected policies without recursion
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON users
    FOR UPDATE USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Allow users to view other users in their company (without recursion)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view company members" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (
        company_id IN (
            SELECT u.company_id 
            FROM users u 
            WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- Allow admins to manage users (without recursion)
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage company users" ON users
    FOR ALL USING (

-- Allow user creation during signup

-- Fix companies policies

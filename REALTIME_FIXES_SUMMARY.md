# Real-Time Data Updates - Fix Summary

## Problem
Data was only visible after refreshing the page repeatedly. Users had to manually refresh to see updated information across all modules.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Channel naming conflicts** - Each component used different channel names that could conflict
2. **Missing proper cleanup** - Channels weren't properly removed, causing memory leaks
3. **Inconsistent debouncing** - Different debounce strategies across components
4. **Missing table subscriptions** - Some important tables weren't being watched
5. **No cross-component communication** - Changes in one module didn't trigger updates in others

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Real-Time Subscriptions
**Fixed in all components:**
- **Unique channel names** with timestamps to prevent conflicts
- **Comprehensive table coverage** - subscribing to all relevant tables
- **Proper cleanup** with timeout clearing and error handling
- **Consistent debouncing** (300ms) across all components
- **Detailed logging** for debugging real-time events

### 2. Global Event System
**New file:** `app/hooks/useRealtimeUpdates.ts`
- **Global event emitter** for cross-component communication
- **Centralized real-time management** with reusable hook
- **Event broadcasting** for company-wide updates

### 3. Global Refresh Mechanism
**Enhanced:** `app/page.tsx`
- **Global refresh key** passed to all components
- **Cross-component updates** when data changes anywhere
- **Branding update propagation** across the entire application

### 4. Component-Specific Improvements

#### DashboardHome.tsx
- **8 table subscriptions**: job_postings, interviews, interview_reports, interview_invitations, candidates, users, companies, company_branding
- **User-specific updates** for subscription changes
- **Global refresh key response**

#### CompanyProfile.tsx
- **3 table subscriptions**: company_branding, users, team_invitations
- **Branding update broadcasting** to other components
- **Team member real-time updates**

#### JobPostings.tsx
- **1 table subscription**: job_postings
- **Real-time job creation/updates/deletion**

#### InterviewManagement.tsx
- **2 table subscriptions**: interview_invitations, interviews
- **Real-time interview status updates**

#### CandidateReports.tsx
- **1 table subscription**: interview_reports
- **Real-time report generation updates**

#### AnalyticsInsights.tsx
- **6 table subscriptions**: job_postings, interviews, interview_reports, analytics_events, analytics_metrics, analytics_trends
- **Comprehensive analytics real-time updates**

## Technical Implementation Details

### Channel Naming Convention
```typescript
const channel = supabase.channel(`component-rt-${companyId}-${Date.now()}`);
```

### Debounced Refresh Pattern
```typescript
let timer: any;
const refresh = () => { 
  clearTimeout(timer); 
  timer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Component: Refreshing data due to real-time update');
    setReloadKey(Date.now());
  }, 300); 
};
```

### Global Refresh Response
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (globalRefreshKey && globalRefreshKey > 0) {
    console.log('Component: Global refresh triggered');
    setReloadKey(globalRefreshKey);
  }
}, [globalRefreshKey]);
```

### Proper Cleanup
```typescript
return () => {
  clearTimeout(timer);
  try { 
    supabase.removeChannel(channel);
    console.log('Component: Removed realtime channel');
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Component: Error removing channel:', e);
  }
};
```

## Real-Time Tables Monitored

| Component | Tables Monitored |
|-----------|------------------|
| DashboardHome | job_postings, interviews, interview_reports, interview_invitations, candidates, users, companies, company_branding |
| CompanyProfile | company_branding, users, team_invitations |
| JobPostings | job_postings |
| InterviewManagement | interview_invitations, interviews |
| CandidateReports | interview_reports |
| AnalyticsInsights | job_postings, interviews, interview_reports, analytics_events, analytics_metrics, analytics_trends |

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Instant Updates** - Data changes are reflected immediately across all modules
2. **No Manual Refresh** - Users no longer need to refresh pages to see updates
3. **Cross-Module Sync** - Changes in one module instantly update related data in other modules
4. **Better Performance** - Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and channel conflicts
5. **Debugging Support** - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting real-time issues
6. **Scalable Architecture** - Global event system allows easy addition of new real-time features

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a job posting** - Should instantly appear in Dashboard and JobPostings modules
2. **Update company branding** - Should instantly reflect in Sidebar and all modules
3. **Invite a team member** - Should instantly appear in CompanyProfile team section
4. **Schedule an interview** - Should instantly appear in InterviewManagement and Dashboard
5. **Generate a report** - Should instantly appear in CandidateReports and Analytics
6. **Switch between modules** - All data should be current without refresh

## Console Logging

All real-time events are logged with the format:
```
Component: table_name changed: eventType
Component: Refreshing data due to real-time update
Component: Global refresh triggered
Component: Removed realtime channel
```

This provides full visibility into the real-time update flow for debugging purposes.
